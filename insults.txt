I'm looking forward to the pleasure of % company since I haven't had it yet.
When $ pass away and people ask me what the cause of % death was, I'll say % stupidity.
Well I'll see $ in my dreams - if I eat too much.
I've had many cases of love that was just infatuation, but this hate I feel for $ is the real thing.
^ is the best at all $ do - and all $ do is make people hate ^.
Doesn't $ realize that there are enough people to hate in the world already
without % working so hard to give us another?
The thing that terrifies me the most is that someone might hate me as much as I loathe ^.
When $ get run over by a car it shouldn't be listed under accidents.
All of % ancestors must number in the millions; its hard to believe that
many people are to blame for producing ^.

If $ ever taxes % brain, don't charge more than a penny.
Doesn't ^ have a terribly empty feeling ---- in % skull?
